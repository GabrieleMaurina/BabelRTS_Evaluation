This experiments takes few minutes up to several hours to complete depending
on your HW configuration. For your convenience, our results are already
included in folder results and plots.

  ```
### Additional Notes
In this folder we have also included all the plots (folder plots) and tables
(folder tables) that didn't find space in the paper.

We have not included the code to compute the time reduction because it is not been cleaned and standardized yet. Please contact the authors if you are interested in this code.
